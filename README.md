# MotherForSmoothie

#####DEVELOPMENT IN PROGRESS! UNTESTED!

Motherboad for LPCxpresso1769 and Pololu DRV8825 or compatible for running the awesome smoothieware. If you do have a spare LPCxpresso (maybe from a smoothie on breadboard experiment?) and dont need all of smoothieboards features this is for you.

-1 big mosfet (heated bed?)

-1 small mosfet (extruder?)

-1 small mosfet connected to 12V (fan?)

-ATX connector for power supply, no internal regulators

#####What needs to be done?
